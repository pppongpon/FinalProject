# FinalProject

This project presents search and recommendation system for job seeking and recruiting. 
We develop an android application for 2 groups of users including employees and employers.

For employees, they can make announcements for desired jobs, or search for available 
jobs in the system. The system can also recommend relevant jobs to the employees. The 
employees can apply the jobs, and also make employment contracts through the application.

For Employers, they can post a job announcement, or search for employees who are 
looking for work in the system. The system can also recommend suitable employees for job that 
employer announcement. The employer can make employment contracts through the 
application and contact with employees. There is also a bookmark and contact system for 
employers and employees.
